# kyverno-http-authorizer

Authenticate HTTP requests using kyverno validating policies in a sidecar architecture

## Overview 

[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/what_is_envoy) is a L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures . Envoy (v1.7.0+) supports an External Authorization filter which calls an authorization service to check if the incoming request is authorized or not. [External Authorization filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/security/ext_authz_filter.html) feature will help us to make a decision based on Kyverno policies .
